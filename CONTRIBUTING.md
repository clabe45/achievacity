# Contributing to Achievacity
**Welcome.** Thank you for showing your interest in Achievacity! We're glad you're here! Any kind of contribution is welcome.

## Environment
Suggested steps to setting up your development environment:
1. Create a blank folder for localhost named `achievacity`.
2. Download [User Spice](https://userspice.com) and extract to your project folder.
3. Open `index.php` and follow install directions.
4. Clone git repo.
5. Import [.db/achievacity.sql](.db/achievacity.sql) into an SQL server (it also creates the database itself), and you're done!

## Submitting Changes
A good ol' pull request is sufficient for now.

## Styleguide
1. Write clean code. [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Stay consistent to the project style:
```
if (true) {

}
```

opposed to

```
if (true)
{

}
```

2. Leave comments where another developer would ask a question.

## Additional Notes
This project is very new and empty, but these documents will grow as the app does!
