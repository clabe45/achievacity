Suggested steps to setting up your development environment:

2. Download [User Spice](https://userspice.com/) and extract to your project folder.
3. Open `index.php` and follow install directions.
4. Clone git repo.
5. Import [.db/achievacity.sql](.db/achievacity) into an SQL server (it also creates the database itself), and you're done!

## Submitting Changes
A good ol' pull request is sufficient for now.

opposed to
